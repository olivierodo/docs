Obtaining VMWare player If your laptop doesn't have VMware player installed, in the first instance open Software center from the start menu and see if it is available. If it is, install it from here. If it is not available for you in Software Center, speak to service desk (or ideally Matt Page, as he managed this rollout originally) to have this added to your software center. Obtaining the VM image The first step of the process is to access the image which is held on: \\\\\\\\business.ukho.gov.uk\\dfs\\Prod_Prod\\Mint\\OVF Image U:\\Prod_Prod\\Mint\\OVF Image and copy this directory to your laptop. Once copied, start up VMware Player Pro and on the \"Home Screen\" select the option \"Open a Virtual Machine\": Please use the file browser displayed to select the location where the image was copied. You will recieve a dialog referring to a mismatch of versions, this is a known bug in VMWare workstation, press Retry and the process will continue. You will be asked for a name and a storage path - please ensure that the name of the VM image is: UKHO CentOS 7 Please ensure that the storage path of the VM image is: C:\\VirtualMachines\\DevVM Danger It is important that the specified location is used for compliance with SyOps! Settings for the VM image Ensure the 'tab' for the virtual machine in the UI is selected and click on the 'Edit Virtual Machine Settings' link on the left-hand-side of the page: In the window displayed, select the 'Network Adapter' entry on the left hand side. In the right hand side of the same window, ensure that the following settings are selected under \"Network connection\": \"Bridged\" mode is selected Replicate physical network connection state is selected. Click OK when done. Installation - Initial Packages Start-up the Virtual Machine by selecting the \"Power On\" (Ctrl+B) option. You will shortly see a screen having the option \"Install Centos 7 - With Hydro Kickstart\". Press Enter to continue: You will then see a screen which displays \"Press to start the installation process\" - either press Enter (or wait and the install should start automatically. This starts the kickstart installation process. After some minutes (Approx. 7mins, Go grab a lengthy coffee/tea/soft drink) you should see the following: Press return. You will get a message box stating that the machine has halted. Select the \"Restart Guest\" option (or press Ctrl+R) on the VM power settings. Warning Don't try this on UKHO_LAPTOPS wifi, as the setup will not be able to access GitHub After a few minutes the VM should boot and you should be presented with a login prompt: Enter the following: For username: root For password: Example joe.bloggs jane.doe Username constraints The username must be: Lower-case Alphabetic No spaces Next, you will be asked for your full name, which should be alphabetic Next, you will be asked for your password: Warning There are restrictions on the password you can use; passwords which are too lenient will be rejected. The set of interactions (for a user named jane.doe) might look as follows: The installation process will then continue, and you should see a login manager displayed after some time: Press space, this will display a set of users you can log in as (initially, this is the user you created earlier): Login by selecting the name of the user you entered earlier and enter the password, you should be presented with a screen as follows: Initially, this looks a little spartan! You can get an initial desktop created by selecting the 'Use Default Config' option - you should then see something as follows: Installing development utils Once you have logged in, if you wish to install maven, Java 8 Sdk and Yarn please go to a terminal and type: cd ~/linux-workstation/ansible sudo ansible-playbook -i inventories/laptop-vm/hosts --vault-password-file=$HOME/.config/linux-workstation/.vaultpass development.yml This should then install the basic utilities needed.

It must contain the processes that the owner of the repository needs people to follow when contributing to the project. Guidance on how to write a CONTRIBUTING.md . A LICENSE within the root folder.

This must contain some basic useful information for the user allowing them to quickly understand the project and get started using it. It isn't the place for extensive documentation. Guidance on what should be in a README.md can be found . A continuous integration build process.

As an organisation we recognise the importance of embracing test automation and utilising it to enable faster development and release of our software products. This strategy acts as a baseline for UKHO development teams, with teams empowered to determine how their teams will adhere to this strategy. This document includes: The UHO Test Automation Model Ways of Working Principles of Automation at UKHO Standards How we measure our progress The UHO Test Automation Model To summarise our approach to test automation we created our take on the standard Test Pyramid Model. This promotes: The areas of testing we aim to automate The correct level in the pyramid we should add testing Principles of Test Automation at UKHO We aim to deliver quality improvement to UKHO development using test automation. We promote that all team using automation should adhere to these principles: New functionality must be covered by passing automated tests (unless there is a legitimate reason not to) Make use of test design patterns and principles Add tests at the correct level of the test pyramid \u2013 lower is better Have a test management process (reviewing execution time, test relevance, code refactoring) for automated tests Test Results are made visible to the team Follow the \u201cgreen tests run\u201d policy All tests should be independent Ways of Working Test automation has provided the opportunity to move away from the traditional developer \u2013 tester divide and move towards an integrated way of working.

Why do we Test? To build confidence in our systems Detect defects Generate information Manage quality risks To deliver value to our customers How do we measure the effectiveness of testing? Delivery to customers of software and hardware that provides business value. UKHO Long Term Testing Goals To move to a DevOps Model Test Automation provides the bulk of testing functionality High Value manual testing is used Testing across UKHO is done within an Agile framework Who Tests? Test Engineering line manages a group of test engineers, ranging from junior to lead people; they provide testing capability across most of UKHO where testing is carried out within Scrum teams. Outside of the Scrum teams other people do test, for instance within Operations testing of hardware is carried out by the relevant SME, like network engineers carry out network testing. In some non-Agile teams, Business Analysts also carry out testing. Who Manages Testing? The Head of Test line manages all test engineers, but test engineers are task-managed by the overall technology program in conjunction with the Head of Test. Other areas of the business carry out various testing activities, but these people will not necessarily be professional software testers, they are line managed by their relevant program. Roles and Responsibilities of Test Engineering This will only deal with the roles within Test Engineering. In Scope All software applications Any changes to database structures Third-party software Cloud-based applications The Testing Life-Cycle UKHO follows the Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) and testing forms part of that lifecycle process which is collectively referred to as the Agile Delivery Governance Framework (ADGF). Testing will be carried out at all stages of development of software and products. There are sub-policies that cover the Agile and Non-Agile methods as well as security, penetration, load and performance testing. The test guidance within the ADGF provides guidance/support for all teams that will carry out testing across UKHO. International Standards Our baseline for standards is ISO/IEC 29119 .
